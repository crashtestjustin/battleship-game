# battleship-game

Battleship game is my first project using primarily TDD techniques.

To DO:

- create fleet list that updates dynamically as ships sink (desktop view only)
- Update styling for multiple display sizes (hide fleet list on mobile)
- update UI styling
- Update the UI to stop the game once a winner is announced (remove event listener)
